- ## Major Projects
     - [Predictive Modeling for Car Insurance Cold Calls (Language: R)](https://github.com/jagerian/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/master/Predictive%20Modeling%20for%20Car%20Insurance%20Cold%20Calls/Predictive%20Modeling%20for%20Car%20Insurance%20Cold%20Calls_10Jan2018.ipynb): Decision making model that prioritises the chance of closing a deal with prospect or client. There are a lot of Classification Predictor Algorithms and in this case I have utilized most of the classification algorithms related to the problem.
     
     - [Sentiment Aanalysis on NAVER Movie Reviews (Language: Python)](https://github.com/jagerian/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/master/Sentiment%20Aanalysis%20on%20NAVER%20Movie%20Reviews/Sentiment%20Aanalysis%20on%20NAVER%20Movie%20Reviews.ipynb): The goal of this project is to create a sentiment analysis model that classifies the sentiment of sentences from NAVER movie reviews.
     
     - [Solving Parcel Traffic by Deep-Learning & Sharing Economy (Language: Python)](https://www.slideshare.net/secret/sxc5rkZtpzGz0y): This is the project for 2018 Big Data Hackathon held by Korea Post. The goal of this project is to create demand forecast model for parcel volume on holiday seasons using RNN-LSTM algorithm and suggest idea to solve the issue.
