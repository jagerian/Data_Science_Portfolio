Participants are free to pick one from among five subjects for both themes and work on it to come up with a solution.
     
     - [Predictive Modeling for Car Insurance Cold Calls (Language: R)](https://github.com/jagerian/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/master/Predictive%20Modeling%20for%20Car%20Insurance%20Cold%20Calls/Predictive%20Modeling%20for%20Car%20Insurance%20Cold%20Calls_10Jan2018.ipynb): Decision making model that prioritises the chance of closing a deal with prospect or client. There are a lot of Classification Predictor Algorithms and in this case I have utilized most of the classification algorithms related to the problem.
     
     - [Sentiment Aanalysis on NAVER Movie Reviews (Language: Python)](https://github.com/jagerian/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/master/Sentiment%20Aanalysis%20on%20NAVER%20Movie%20Reviews/Sentiment%20Aanalysis%20on%20NAVER%20Movie%20Reviews.ipynb): The goal of this project is to create a sentiment analysis model that classifies the sentiment of sentences from NAVER movie reviews.
