- ## Major Projects
     - [Deep-Learning based Hourly Fine Dust Forecast (Language: Python)](https://www.slideshare.net/secret/2cSovAnNkwp0HP): This is the project submitted to 2018 EnviornmentÂ·Weather Big Data Competition held by National Information Society Agency & K-Weather in December 2018. The objective of this competition is to solve fine dust issues with a solution using the big data provided by K-Weather. As a result of the competition, this project has been awarded the excellence award along with prize money of KRW 500,000.
     
     - [Solving Parcel Traffic by Deep-Learning & Sharing Economy (Language: Python)](https://www.slideshare.net/secret/oAhJS6pWbErfoP): This is the project submitted to 2018 Big Data Hackathon held by Korea Post on 20th & 21st December 2018. The objective of this hackathon is to solve parcel traffic on holiday seasons. Participants have to build a predictive model using the data provided by Korea Post and come up with a solution within 24 hours.
     
     - [Predictive Modeling for Car Insurance Cold Calls (Language: R)](https://github.com/jagerian/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/master/Predictive%20Modeling%20for%20Car%20Insurance%20Cold%20Calls/Predictive%20Modeling%20for%20Car%20Insurance%20Cold%20Calls_10Jan2018.ipynb): Decision making model that prioritises the chance of closing a deal with prospect or client. There are a lot of Classification Predictor Algorithms and in this case I have utilized most of the classification algorithms related to the problem.
     
     - [Sentiment Aanalysis on NAVER Movie Reviews (Language: Python)](https://github.com/jagerian/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/master/Sentiment%20Aanalysis%20on%20NAVER%20Movie%20Reviews/Sentiment%20Aanalysis%20on%20NAVER%20Movie%20Reviews.ipynb): The goal of this project is to create a sentiment analysis model that classifies the sentiment of sentences from NAVER movie reviews.
     



     
- ## Minor Projects
     - [Movie Recommendation System (Language: Python)](https://github.com/jagerian/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/master/Movie%20Recommendation%20System/Movie%20Recommendation%20System.ipynb): The goal of this project is to build a movie recommendation system using item based collaborative filtering.
